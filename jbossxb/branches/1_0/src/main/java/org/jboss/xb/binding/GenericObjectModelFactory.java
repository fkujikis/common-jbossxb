/**
 * Direct implementations of <code>ObjectModelFactory</code> interface can be thought of as "typed" factories
 * in a sense that parameter types of <code>newChild</code>, <code>addChild</code> and <code>setValue</code> methods
 * (discovered by the framework at runtime with introspection) are supposed to be of specific Java classes
 * (other than <code>java.lang.Object</code>) from the target class hierarchy.
 * <p/>In this interface, <code>newChild</code>, <code>addChild</code> and <code>setValue</code> methods are defined
 * with arguments of type <code>java.lang.Object</code>.
 * <br/>The framework won't introspect an implementation of this interface for "typed" implementations of
 * <code>newChild</code>, <code>addChild</code> and <code>setValue</code> methods.
 * Instead it will call the declared generic methods and it's the responsibility of the implementation
 * of this interface to recognize the types and build the object graph appropriately.
